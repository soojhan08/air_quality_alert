# air_quality_alert

Hey there! I wanted to create an app that sends a notification depending on what the air quality is around you. 
I went to IQAir to get the API.
With the help of ChatGPT, I created the lines of codes.
It shows messages depending on whether the air quality is equal to or below 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300.

This is my first ever Python project, so I learned a lot of the basics like what tools I needed (Python 3.9 to go along with ChatGPT's most updated knowledge, Command on Windows, Notebook++),
How to open and save files, etc.

I'm running into an issue where I'm not getting any output from this code. I was wondering if anybody can help?

Thanks in advance!
