# air_quality_alert

Hey there! 

Welcome to my first-ever self-taught Python project.
With an interest in using AI and coding to combat climate change, I wanted to dip my toes into the water with a simple challenge to get to know the basics of Python programming language.

I used ChatGPT for help and guidance.

The idea for this project was to create a program that sends a message depending on the air quality of your location.
Using an API key from IQAir, and with the help of ChatGPT, I developed these lines of codes that states one of the following messages:

        "Air quality is excellent. Enjoy outdoor activities!",
        "Air quality is good.",
        "Air quality is moderate. Consider outdoor activities.",
        "Air quality is unhealthy for sensitive groups. Limit outdoor activities.",
        "Air quality is unhealthy. Avoid outdoor activities.",
        "Air quality is very unhealthy. Stay indoors and keep safe."

The idea is to notify users about the health or unhealthiness of the air quality around them with live information.

This entire project took me around 4 hours to complete -- most of it had to do with troubleshooting and figuring out basic, basic controls like...

        - How to open Windows Command (lol)
        - How to toggle Python 3.9 instead of the latest version, Python 3.11 (I used Python 3.9 because that is the most up-to-date knowledge for ChatGPT)
        - Opening and saving files (I hope I look back at this one day and laugh at how long this took me)
        - The need for and downloading/using Notebook++

I also learned how to use ChatGPT to learn how to code, as well as its limitations. For example, ChatGPT is good at finding issues with code like indentations. However, I discovered that I eventually had to post on Stack Overflow to figure out why I wasn't getting any output because ChatGPT was taking me in circles and we weren't able to come to a solution (it eventually had to do with something simple like the print call to action). So, what I discovered was that ChatGPT is good at giving immediate logical feedback, but not so much problem-solving. I think I'll continue relying on the community (Github, Stack Overflow) if I ever run into another coding issue where ChatGPT does not have the answer.

In summary, I was able to successfully complete and run this project within 4 hours with the help of ChatGPT and fellow peers on Stack Overflow, and I learned super basic tools to navigate the programming world. I'm proud of the idea that I came up with, especially since it's one close to my heart, and I check the air quality very frequently because of the location that I am at. It's straightforward to create simple codes with ChatGPT, but tweaking it and solving more complex issues require outside help. When it comes to coming up with creative ideas, human minds beat ChatGPT.

Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed my journey.

Cheers,
